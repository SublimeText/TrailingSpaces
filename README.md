## Synopsis

This is a [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) plugin.

**Highlight trailing spaces and delete them in a flash.**

ST2 provides a way to automatically delete trailing spaces upon file save.
Depending on your settings, it may be more handy to just highlight them and/or
delete them by hand. This plugin provides just that!

## Installation

Go to your `Packages` subdirectory under ST2's data directory:

* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2`
* OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages`
* Linux: `~/.config/sublime-text-2`
* Portable Installation: `Sublime Text 2/Data`

Then clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/SublimeText/TrailingSpaces.git

That's it!

## Options

Several options are available to customize the plugin look 'n feel. The
config keys goes into config files accessible throught the "Preferences"
menu.

### Bind the deletion command to a shortcut

In order to use the deletion feature, one must add the mapping by hand
(this should probably go into "Key Bindings - User"):

``` js
{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+t"], "command": "delete_trailing_spaces" }

Here, pressing Ctrl + Shift + t will delete all trailing spaces.
```

### Change the highlighting color

One may also change the highlighting color, providing a scope name such
as "invalid", "comment"... in "File Settings - User":

``` js
{ "trailing_spaces_highlight_color": "invalid" }
```

Actually, "invalid" is the default value. If you'd like to use a custom color,
it should be defined as a color scope in your theme file. Feel free to ask me
how to do it.

### Disabling highlighting for large files

Highlighting may be disabled for large files. The default threshold is around
1M chars. This is configurable (in "File Settings - User"); unit is number of chars:

``` js
{ "trailing_spaces_file_max_size": 1000}
```

Even though the trailing spaces are not highlighted, one can still delete them
using the deletion command.

### Disabling highlighting for current line

Highlighting trailing spaces for the current line being edited can be disabled
so the warning color is not seen after every space character when adding to a
line of code

``` js
{ "trailing_spaces_include_current_line": false}
```

Even though the trailing spaces are not highlighted, one can still delete them
using the deletion command.
